# chatbot_with_ChatGPT
<p>Welcome to the repository for the Chatbot with ChatGPT project!
In this project, I have created a chatbot powered by the ChatGPT language model API. The chatbot is designed to engage in natural language conversations on a wide range of topics. To use the chatbot and access its functionalities, you will need to obtain a ChatGPT API KEY, which will grant you access to the language model through the OpenAI API.</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
To get started with the chatbot, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```python
git clone https:https://github.com/AlexVic1/chatbot_with_ChatGPT
```

2.Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3.Obtain a ChatGPT API KEY by signing up on the OpenAI website:
Go to https://openai.com/signup and create an account to obtain your ChatGPT API KEY.

4.Store your API KEY securely. Never expose your API KEY publicly, as it provides access to the ChatGPT API and may have usage limitations tied to your account.

*Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the ChatGPT API KEY you obtained earlier.

<h1>Interacting with the Chatbot</h1>
The chatbot application allows you to have a conversation with the ChatGPT language model in real-time. Simply type your messages in the command line, and the chatbot will respond accordingly.
